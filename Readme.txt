Mind Opener is a simple web-based game of Tic-Tac-Toe that requires two players to play. The game was created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
To play the game, each player takes turns placing their mark (either X or O) on the game board. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all spaces on the board are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

Click the "Start Game" button to begin.
Players take turns clicking on an empty square to place their mark.
The game continues until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
